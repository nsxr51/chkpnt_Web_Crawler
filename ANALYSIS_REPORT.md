## 1. System Architecture & Data Flow

### 1.1 High-Level Data Flow

The web crawler follows a systematic data flow pattern that ensures efficient processing and storage:

```
[Input URL] → [Crawler Engine] → [Content Extraction] → [Word Analysis] → [Data Storage] → [Analysis & Reporting]
```

### 1.2 Detailed Data Flow Process

#### Stage 1: Initialization & Configuration
- **Input**: Starting URL and configuration parameters
- **Processing**: Load crawler settings (depth, delays, filters)
- **Output**: Configured crawler instance with performance metrics tracking

#### Stage 2: Content Retrieval
- **Input**: Target URLs from queue
- **Processing**: 
  - Robots.txt compliance check
  - HTTP request with timeout and error handling
  - Response validation and content type verification
- **Output**: Raw HTML content and metadata (response time, status codes)

#### Stage 3: Content Extraction & Processing
- **Input**: Raw HTML content
- **Processing**:
  - Parse HTML using Cheerio DOM parser
  - Extract meaningful text content (excluding scripts, styles, navigation)
  - Identify and normalize internal links
  - Clean and preprocess text data
- **Output**: Structured content data with extracted text and links

#### Stage 4: Word Frequency Analysis
- **Input**: Cleaned text content
- **Processing**:
  - Tokenization (split text into individual words)
  - Normalization (lowercase, remove punctuation)
  - Filtering (exclude short words, common stop words)
  - Frequency counting and aggregation
- **Output**: Word frequency maps and statistical metrics

#### Stage 5: Data Storage & Persistence
- **Input**: Processed page data and word frequencies
- **Processing**:
  - Aggregate data across all crawled pages
  - Generate summary statistics and performance metrics
  - Format data for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV)
- **Output**: Structured data files with complete crawl results

#### Stage 6: Analysis & Reporting
- **Input**: Stored crawl data
- **Processing**:
  - Statistical analysis of word frequencies
  - Performance metric calculation
  - Content pattern identification
  - Trend analysis and insights generation
- **Output**: Comprehensive reports with visualizations and recommendations

### 1.3 Data Structures & Storage

#### Primary Data Structures
1. **Page Data Object**:
   ```javascript
   {
     url: string,
     depth: number,
     title: string,
     wordCount: number,
     totalWords: number,
     linkCount: number,
     timestamp: ISO string,
     responseTime: number,
     words: Map<string, number>,
     links: string[]
   }
   ```

2. **Global Word Frequency Map**:
   ```javascript
   Map<word: string, frequency: number>
   ```

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   ```javascript
   {
     requestCount: number,
     successfulRequests: number,
     averageResponseTime: number,
     responseTimes: number[],
     wordsPerPage: number[]
   }
   ```

#### Storage Strategy
- **In-Memory Processing**: Uses Maps and Arrays for efficient real-time processing
- **Persistent Storage**: JSON files for detailed data, CSV for word frequency analysis
- **Structured Output**: Hierarchical organization with metadata and raw data separation
